INSTALL
-------

- run 'make install' as a user to put bash scripts in place
- make sure you source the script in your .bashrc or .bash_profile
  source $HOME/.bashrc.d/git

  (I have these lines in .bashrc to do so:

if test -e ~/.bashrc.d
then
  for f in ~/.bashrc.d/*
  do
    source $f
  done
fi

- set the prompt in your .bashrc or .bash_profile with
  PS1="\$(parse_git_branch)$PS1"
